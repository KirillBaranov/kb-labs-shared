## 🎯 Vision

KB Labs Shared provides common types and utilities without side effects for all KB Labs products. It enables fast bootstrap, unified quality rules, simple publishing, and reusable core utilities across the ecosystem. This project serves as the shared foundation for product-agnostic domain utilities.

The project solves the problem of code duplication across KB Labs products by providing reusable utilities that don't introduce side effects or dependencies on external services. All packages in Shared are pure, testable, and can be used in any context without concerns about async operations or external state.

This project is part of the **@kb-labs** ecosystem and is used by all KB Labs products as a foundation for common operations like diff parsing, text processing, boundary checking, and profile management.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development mode for all packages
pnpm dev

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint code
pnpm lint
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Using diff parser
import { parseUnifiedDiff, listChangedFiles } from '@kb-labs/shared-diff';

const diff = await parseUnifiedDiff(diffString);
const changedFiles = await listChangedFiles(diff);

// Using text operations
import { normalizeText, similarity } from '@kb-labs/shared-textops';

const normalized = normalizeText(text);
const score = similarity(text1, text2);

// Using boundaries checker
import { checkBoundaries } from '@kb-labs/shared-boundaries';

const violations = await checkBoundaries({
  rules: boundaryRules,
  files: sourceFiles
});
```

## ✨ Features

- **Zero Side Effects**: All utilities are pure functions without external dependencies
- **Module Boundary Checking**: Enforce import boundaries with configurable rules
- **Diff Parsing**: Unified diff parser with file change detection
- **Text Processing**: Normalization, similarity, and text operation utilities
- **Profile Management**: Project profile management and resolution utilities
- **CLI UI Utilities**: Shared CLI output formatting and command discovery
- **Repository Utilities**: Git repository metadata and utilities
- **Review Types**: Shared types for review systems
